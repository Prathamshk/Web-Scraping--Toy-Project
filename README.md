Web Scraping Project: Extracting Largest U.S. Companies by Revenue-

Project Overview-
This project involves web scraping to collect and analyze data from a Wikipedia page listing the largest companies in the United States by revenue. We used various Python libraries to retrieve, parse, and export this data into a structured format.

Steps Involved-

Data Retrieval-
The initial step involved accessing the Wikipedia page using the requests library to retrieve its HTML content. This setup ensures a reliable connection for smooth data extraction.

HTML Parsing-
The HTML content was parsed using the BeautifulSoup library. This step focused on identifying and isolating the specific table containing the company data, allowing for efficient navigation through the HTML structure.\

Data Extraction-
We extracted the table headers to set up a structured DataFrame. Each row of data was carefully collected, and extraneous whitespace was removed to ensure clean and accurate data entry.

Data Structuring-
The extracted data was organized into a DataFrame, aligning each piece of information with the corresponding headers. This process involved managing data types and handling any inconsistencies.

Data Export-
The final step was to save the refined dataset into a CSV file, making it easily accessible for further analysis or visualization.

Prerequisites-
To replicate this project, you need to have Python installed along with libraries like requests, beautifulsoup4, and pandas.

Usage-
This project serves as a demonstration of web scraping techniques and data processing using Python. It showcases how to handle complex datasets and prepare them for analysis.

Files-
The main script performs web scraping and data processing, resulting in a CSV file named companies.csv containing the structured data.
